# Auto Disable Screen Reader VS Code Extension

> [!NOTE]
> This project was AI-generated by **Maxim Mazurok** using **Google Antigravity with Gemini 3 Flash**.

This extension automatically ensures that `editor.accessibilitySupport` is set to `off` in your VS Code settings. This is useful when using tools like Wispr Flow that might trigger VS Code's "Screen Reader Optimized" mode, which can interfere with keyboard shortcuts (e.g., accepting Copilot suggestions).

## Features

- **Auto-Disable**: Automatically reverts `editor.accessibilitySupport` to `off` whenever it changes.
- **Polling Fallback**: Periodically checks the setting (default every 500ms) to ensure it stays disabled, even if event listeners miss a change.
- **Configurable**: You can enable/disable the extension or adjust the polling interval.

## Configuration

- `autoDisableScreenReader.enabled`: Enable or disable the auto-disabling logic.
- `autoDisableScreenReader.enablePolling`: Enable polling as a fallback if event listeners are not enough.
- `autoDisableScreenReader.pollingInterval`: Interval in milliseconds to check and disable screen reader mode (default: 500ms).
